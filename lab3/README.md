Module pingpong contains code that simulates traditional ping pong game, by creating two processes that communicate with each other
as if they were playing ping pong.
Module parcel implements finding closest point from one points set to each point from another points set. Implementation enables calculations 
to be run simultaneously on as many processes as user wishes. The best performance is achieved when the number of parallely running 
processes is equal to the number of cores on your device.
